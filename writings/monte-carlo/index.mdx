Building off of our [Blinn-Phong simple recursive ray tracer](), Vivian and I implemented a Monte-Carlo recursive ray tracer using indirect diffuse lighting in stages. Using low-discrepancy sequencing and simple sampling, we gave our image the effect of “filling in gaps” so that a given area can be covered more evenly and quickly compared to the completely randomized approach.

While I can't disclose the details of my project implementation due to Stanford's Honor Code, feel free to [contact me](mailto:amyflo@stanford.edu) if you would like to learn more.
